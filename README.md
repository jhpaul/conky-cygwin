conky-cygwin
============

Attempted to get conky to compile under cygwin. Didn't have much success, and even if I can compile, I suspect issues getting to integrate nicely with windows (would most likely make an X window with the conky display inside, rather than actually embedded in desktop). May come back to it later.
